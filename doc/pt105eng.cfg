;
;======================== Main section ============================

; Keyword Address sets the address and AKAs of your system.
;
; Your main address should be indicated first.  You can indicate unlimited
; number of addresses.  When exchanging echomail (and packed netmail)
; with other stations, the most appropriate AKA is chosen by Parma Tosser
; (in its opinion).  When it's impossible to chose the appropriate AKA,
; the first address in the list is used.

Address 2:5030/177
Address 2:5030/177.777
Address 666:5030/177
Address 2:5030/51.3
Address 2:5030/31.13

; Keyword EnableSelfAKAs turns off the checking for matching between your
; subscriber's address and one of your system's AKAs.  This helps you
; to use some robots, which generate packets from your address, which
; should be imported into echo-area.

;EnableSelfAKAs

; Keyword SysOpName sets the user names, for who the mail will be copied
; into a separate echo-area of general use, separate area for each user,
; or one area for several users, and also the name of this echo-area and
; fields of a letter in which the mail search will be made.
; There are four types of fields scanned by ParToss: from, to, both and
; subj.  If the name of the user is two or more words - first and last
; names, then it should be in quotation marks.  Same applies to field
; subj.  You can also indicate party of name.  Instead of keyword SysOpName
; you can use its synonyms - CarbonCopy, CarbonMove (in last case, after
; copying messages into your personal area, the source letters will be
; deleted, and won't save in your base).
; When using search fields from, to, or both you can indicate address,
; with '%' in front of it, instead of a name.
;
; * Additional feature for registered users.
;
; After you indicated your personal areas, you can indicate a file name,
; which consists the answer template.  In this case, the netmail response
; will be generated (using this template), to each letter that was put in
; the personal area. In this template you can use the same macros, that you
; use in all other templates, but you need to remember, that the these macros
; applied to names and addresses, are filled up from the source letter, and
; in some cases carry somehow inverse meaning.  E.g., greeting, for instance,
; should look like "Hello @FFName!", instead of "Hello @TFName!"
; This feature is used if your station is left on "auto-pilot" for quite some
; time.
;
; Keywords SysOpNameExact, CarbonCopyExact, CarbonMoveExact are almost
; fully identical with SysOpName, CarbonCopy, CarbonMove with only one
; difference that the fields are compared very strictly, and for carbon
; copy the fields need to be fully identical, including the letter case.

;SysOpName "Serge Koghin" SERGE_MAIL both vacation.tpl
;SysOpName "Serge Koghin" SERGE_MAIL both
;CarbonCopy "Parma Tosser" SERGE_MAIL subj
;CarbonMove "Moderator of RU.ANECDOT" MODERATOR from
;CarbonCopy "Moderator" MODERATOR from
;SysOpName %2:5030/177 SERGE_MAIL to
;CarbonCopy %2:5030/177.* SERGE_POINTS both

; Keyword CarbonFromNetMail enables you to carbon copy from netmail areas
; (only when unpacking).

CarbonFromNetMail

; Keyword ForwardString defines the line which will be included as first
; line in each letter, which is forwarded to your personal mail area.
; You can use same macros here as in other templates.  Bye default the
; line is:
; "@Return* Copied from area @Area by Parma Tosser *@Return@Return"
; It could (but not necessarily) be put in quotation marks.

ForwardString @ReturnCopied from area @Area by ParToss @Version@Return@Return

; Keyword Origin defines the Origin line by default.
; In current version it's used only for Post command, if the letter being
; sent to echo-area doesn't have keyword Origin in it's description.  Origin
; could (but not necessarily) be put in quotation marks.

Origin ParmaSoft, Petersburg

;======================== Directories and files ====================

; Keyword NetFile defines the directory, where the incoming ARCmail
; packets are stored.  You can also use keyword Inbound instead of it.
; After the name of the directory you can indicate the modifier Secure,
; which means that this directory is considered as SecureInbound
; You can indicate unlimited number of inbound directories.

NetFile                 d:\tc\Inbound
Inbound                 d:\tc\Inbound\secure Secure
Inbound                 d:\tc\Inbound\unsecure

; Keyword SecureInbound defines the inbound directory, where the incoming
; ARCmail packets are stored.  At this moment they are processed in the
; same matter, as the directory defined by NetFile.  In future ParToss will
; behave differently depending on weather it's Secure or not.

SecureInbound                 d:\tc\partoss

; Keyword Outbound defines the directory, where the outgoing mail bundles will
; be created.  In other words this is group-name. ParToss creates its own
; working directory with .Sq extension; in Bink-Mode the zone numbers
; will be used as extensions for this directory.

Outbound        d:\tc\Outbound

; Keyword WorkOutbound defines the directory, where the outgoing packets
; are created.  By default the current directory is used.

;WorkOutbound        d:\tmp

; Keyword NetMailInbound is used when you want to indicate a specific
; netmail area, where the received to one of your AKAs letters unpacked
; by ParToss will be put.  By default this is the first area defined in
; keyword NetArea.

;NetMailInbound NETMAIL_IN

; Keyword NetMailOutbound is used when you want to indicate a specific
; netmail area, where packed transit mail received by your system or mail
; generated by ParToss (autoposting, echo-manager receipts, etc) will be
; put.  By default this is the first area defined in keyword NetArea.

;NetMailOutbound NETMAIL_OUT

; Keyword NetMailManager is used when you want to indicate a specific
; netmail area, where ParToss will be searching for letters to echo-manager.
; By default all the netmail areas are scanned.

;NetMailManager NETMAIL_MAN

; Keyword AreasBBS defines a file with the area descriptions for BBS.
; This is reserved for future use, and isn't supported in current version.

;AreasBBS        Areas.BBS

; Keyword Compress defines file with compression programs definitions.

Compress        Compress.Cfg

; Keyword Routing defines routing file.  It's used only if netmail packing
; feature is enabled.  The format of this file is incompatible with format
; of Route.Cfg for Squish!

Routing         Route.Cfg

; Keyword LogFile defines the full name of LOG-file.
; Keyword LogLevel controls the type of messages that are placed in LOG-file.
; The more the LogLevel is, the more detailed LOG-file will be, and, of course,
; the size of it will be bigger.  LogLevel 9 and higher is used mostly for
; debugging features, and information in these LogLevels might vary in
; different versions.
;
; * In unregistered version the maximum LogLevel is 3.
; * Higher definitions of this keyword will be ignored.

LogFile         Partoss.Log
LogLevel        11

; Keywords TossStatistic and SendStatistic enable logging of the information
; about the size of received and sent mail for each echo and link.

TossStatistic
SendStatistic

; Keyword WorkDir defines the directory where the temporary files will be
; created (incoming and outgoing packets, etc.)  By default this is current
; directory.  Warning!  Try not to use the working directory of your mailer,
; because the packets created by your mailer will be processed by ParToss.

WorkDir d:\tc\partoss

; Keyword EchoPath defines the directory where the new echo-areas will be
; created if AutoCreate is enabled.

EchoPath d:\tc\echo

; Keyword PostingFile defines the file which contains the information
; necessary for Post function.

PostingFile ParToss.Pst

; Keyword CreateList defines the file, which contains all the necessary
; settings for the autocreated echo-areas reports.  This file has the same
; structure, as the file described by keyword PostingFile, with the exception
; of directive When.  You can post the messages about echo-area creation
; in a few echo-areas at the same time, and send netmail to your permanent
; subscribers using this function.

CreateList ParToss.Crt

; Keyword KillTemplate defines the file, which contains the template for 
; letters-reports about mail deleted with Kill command.

KillTemplate KillOld.Tpl

; Keyword Semaphore defines the file, which will be created as semaphore
; if the outgoing mail was created.  This semaphore can be used by your
; mailer to repack the mail.  You can define as many semaphores as you need.

;Semaphore d:\tc\t-mail\rescan.t-m

; Keyword NetMailSemaphore defines the file, which will be created as 
; semaphore, if at least one netmail letter was created (as the result of
; robot announcements or from the received packet).  There can only be one
; semaphore of this kind.

NetMailSemaphore d:\tc\netmail.sem

; Keyword FlagDirectory defines the directory, where the Busy-flags will 
; be created, which will indicate that at this moment the process is being
; done with certain address.  If this keyword is defined and the arcmail 
; packets append feature is enabled for an address with which the process
; is being done then if Busy flag was detected, then this feature will be
; temporarily disabled, and the mail packet will be moved to a new bundle.
; This check is only done in ArcMailAttach and FileBoxes modes.

FlagDirectory d:\tc\t-mail

; Keyword BadLog enables the creation and maintenance of LOG-file to
; which the areas with damaged structure are recorded.  Also this keyword
; defines the name of LOG-file and the format of the lines, recorded
; for each damaged area.  The first word after this keyword defines the full
; path and the name of this LOG-file.   Next key defines the format of lines
; recorded in LOG-file.  This file includes some parameters of echo-area,  
; defined in template by special macros.  The following macros are recognized:
; @T - area echotag (the name of area).
; @P - full path to the area (directory for netmail, group name of files 
;      for this echo-area).
; @A - full address of AKA which is setup for an area.           
;
; Note:
; - command line option -b<badlog> is disabled;
; - the created file isn't deleted, and keeps adding.

BadLog BadAreas.bat "d:\tc\partoss\sqfix.exe @P.sqd"

; Keyword UnTossDir defines the settings necessary for UnToss command 
; functioning.  First directive after this keyword defines the directory,
; in which the subdirectories will be created according to date of   
; text files being exported will be created.  Second setting modifies the 
; ParToss behavior when executing this command.  Currently you can only     
; define Kill directive.  When Kill is defined, the echo-area will be 
; cleaned up after all the letters from it were imported.

UnTossDir d:\tc\djatlov Kill

;======================== Work methods and parameters ===================

; Keyword ArcmailAttach indicates that all mail-bundles will be supplied
; with letters containing File Attach attribute to use with ArmailAttach-
; style mailer.  You can also use T-Mail file-boxes or Bink-style
; outbound.  
; ArcmailAttach, FileBoxes, BinkMode maybe used all together:  You can 
; define different modes for different links using keyword Link.         

ArcmailAttach

; Keyword BinkMode enables Bink-style Outbound support. This means, that 
; by default all the created bundles will be put into appropriate directory
; and their names will be included in corresponding files *.?ut, which tell
; mailer what to send and where to send the files.

;BinkMode

; Keyword BinkSentBehavior switches modes Kill and Truncate when working in
; BinkMode.  By default all the mail bundles will be deleted after they have
; been sent (Kill). If for some reason it's unacceptable, you can enable 
; Truncate mode, in which all the bundles will be cut to 0 length after they
; have been sent.

;BinkSentBehavior Truncate
;BinkSentBehavior Kill

; Keyword BinkGenerateDLO enables the *.DLO file creation, instead of *.FLO 
; (by default).

;BinkGenerateDLO

; Keyword FileBoxes enables File-Box mode, instead of ArcmailAtttach.
; In this mode, which is supported by T-Mail mailer, instead of creating
; the letter with file-attach for the outgoing bundle, it will be moved
; to file-box - the directory with a special name.  Besides that, after
; the keyword you can indicate the directory, where corresponding boxes
; will be created (if necessary).

;FileBoxes d:\tc\outboxes

; Keyword PackNetMail enables you to pack netmail.  This isn't connected 
; by any means with Bink-mode.  In this mode the netmail letters, which 
; don't have special flags Dir, Cra, Frq, Att etc. will be put in the same
; mail bundles as echo-mail (depending on route rules, described in file
; Route.Cfg).

PackNetMail

; Keyword KillInTransit enables the transit mail deletion after it has been
; packed.

;KillInTransit

; Keyword AddKillSent puts the attribute Kill/Sent in netmail letters, 
; unpacked from received packets.  You can delete transit letters after      
; they have been sent, even if they weren't packed to be sent.

;AddKillSent

; Keyword StripAttributes enables deletion of Crash and Hold attributes from
; transit netmail.

StripAttributes

; Keyword StripExtended adds to keyword StripAttributes.  When enabling this
; keyword all the extended attributes including FTS Reserved, QBBS Reserved,
; etc, will be zeroed.

;StripExtended

; Keyword ForceINTL forces the use of @INTL kludge in all the generated 
; netmail letters, even if sender and receiver have addresses in the same   
; zone.  By default this kludge will only be used when generating inter-zone
; letters.

ForceINTL

; Keyword FixedOutAddress enables the strict use of AKA for each link.
; For example: If you have AKAs in zones 2 and 555, and some echo-area is   
; linked to links from both zones, then the most appropriate sender address
; will be chosen for outgoing mail (by default the address defined by 
; key -p in echo-area description file, or the first address from Address
; list is used)

FixedOutAddress

; Keyword TinySeenBys defines the address list, for who field SEEN-BY: will
; be cut down to only the links for current echo-area on your station.

TinySeenBys 177.1

; Keyword DelFromSeen is made for compatibility with some old software.
; It's used to delete ONE address from SEEN-BY, going through the station.
; The address needed to be deleted is used as parameter for this keyword
; in 2D-format (net/node).

;DelFromSeen 5030/184

; Keyword Secure enables the check of incoming packets for the access level
; of a sender for current echo-area.  If a sender isn't listed when describing
; echo-areas, the letter will be moved to BadArea.

Secure

; Keyword AutoSend automatically executes command Send (or Squash) when 
; executing command Out.  If this keyword is uncommented, then commands:
; ParToss Out Squash
; ParToss Out
; are absolutely identical.  If you comment this keyword then to compress  
; all the mail packets and for creating of FileAttach letters (or when moving 
; packets into file-boxes or Bink Outbound) it's necessary that commands
; Send or Squash are present in command line when using ParToss.  E.g. in this 
; case ParToss will work exactly like Squish.  If you need to do any kind of 
; action on packets before they are packed into bundles, or if you don't want
; to create bundles each time ParToss starts, you need to comment this keyword.

AutoSend

; Keyword AutoCreate enables new area auto-creation, if the echo-area in
; received packet wasn't found.  If this keyword is commented (or the sender 
; is disabled to create new areas in keyword Link), then this letter will 
; be moved to BadArea.  This setting can be switched off for each link.

AutoCreate

; Keyword AutoCreateFromBad enables new area creation when tossing from 
; BadArea (by command Bad) in case the letter was moved to BadArea because
; it wasn't described in configuration file when AutoCreate is disabled.
; By default this option is disabled.

AutoCreateFromBad

; Keyword DefaultArea defines the default settings for newly created 
; echo-areas.  The format of this keyword is the same as of keyword EchoArea,
; but only a few fields are really important: settings indicating the 
; maximum number of letters in an area, the number of letters that are 
; left after purging, the number of days for storage, Passthru indication,
; number of letters stored in Dupe base (same as keyword Duplicates).

DefaultArea DUMMY d:\tc\echo\dummy -$ -$d3 -$m100 -b1000 -$GZ -p2:5030/177

; Keyword ExternalLimits disables the automatical limits update in echo-base
; header, corresponding with settings in echo-area description.  By default,
; the check for limit correspondence is done after each time echo-area was
; opened (maximum number of days for storage, maximum number of letters in 
; base, number of letters that are left after purging) The limits are described
; in area definition file (-$d<age>, -$m<msgs>, -$s<msgs>), and if necessary      
; the area header is being modified as described.  If keyword ExternalLimits
; is uncommented, then this check won't be done.  The definitions of these 
; limits, read from area header will be used.  This option is made for work   
; with external programs, that use their own configuration files to access
; the squish base, which are incompatible with Squish/ParToss formats 
; (for instance, BBS Maximus).
; Note: When using this keyword automatical update of echo-area limits won't
; be done.  You need to use some external programs for it, SQSet.Exe from 
; Squish for instance.

;ExternalLimits

; Keyword Duplicates defines the number of letters, which will be used to
; fined Dupes. This is default setting.  For each echo-area you can set
; up their own limit.  Maximum setting for this keyword is 16000 for 
; DOS-version and 64000 for OS/2 and W32 versions.

Duplicates 1000

; Keyword Killdupes indicates that all the Dupes shouldn't be moved to
; DupeArea and will simply be killed.

;Killdupes

; Keyword DupeLookPath indicates weather it's possible to check for Dupes
; by information stored in field @PATH.  If it's enabled, then on the station
; with node address all the addresses (except last one) in @PATH will be 
; compared with AKA for this echo-area, and if addresses match, then ParToss
; will assume that the letter already came through our station, and will 
; consider it Dupe.  You can disable this check by indicating No in this 
; keyword.  By default this check is enabled.   

;DupeLookPath No

; Keyword NetMailDupes enables you to control the incoming netmail for 
; Dupe presence.

NetMailDupes

; Keyword PurgeAnalyse enables the possibility to analyze weather it's
; necessary to pack echo-areas, described with key -$d (purging according
; to date). By default this feature is disabled.  If you enable it, it will  
; increase the packing speed for these areas, but all the extra information
; (unknown kludges, etc.) won't be deleted.  Of course this only applies 
; for separation of two-way In and Out parsing).
; After this keyword you can indicate the modifier Improved.  In this case 
; the extended mode of two-way parsing is enabled, which in some cases may 
; increase the speed of processing.  But, the number of letters in base  
; is limited in this case (a little bit less than 512K).

;PurgeAnalyse
;PurgeAnalyse Improved

; Keyword PurgeProcents extends the two-way purging process.  When indicated,
; if on first pass ParToss found that it's necessary to delete less letters
; (in percents), than indicated by this keyword, the area won't be processed.

;PurgeProcents 25

; Keyword PurgeKillTrash enables you to delete all the unknown kludges and/or
; lines SEEN-BY and @PATH in Purge mode, if they weren't deleted while tossing
; because the two-way In and Out processing was used.  By default this feature
; is disabled, because in most of cases it's unnecessary, and the speed slows
; down noticeably.

;PurgeKillTrash

; Keyword PurgePassThrough enables you to pack passthru-areas.
; By default this mode is disabled.  ParToss doesn't even touch these areas
; when Purging, instead all the data files and indexes will be deleted after 
; the letters from them were exported.  If this feature is enabled, then the
; data files, and indexes won't be deleted.  Instead, these areas will be 
; processed as the rest of areas.  In this case you can combine keys
; -0 and Purge behavior keys -$dxxx, -$mxxx.

;PurgePassThrough

; Keyword DelKilledPassThru enables to delete files from passthrough-area
; which is behind the echo-manager.  ParToss tries to delete the following 
; files:
; .Sqd - letter file
; .Sqi - index file   
; .Sqp - dupebase file
; .Sql - lastread file (this file is created and maintained by the editor,
; but it doesn't need to be stored, if the base is deleted.)

DelKilledPassThru

; Keyword DefaultPacker defines the default compression program. File 
; Compress.cfg should contain the description of this compressor.

DefaultPacker Zip

; Keyword Buffers sets up the size of main buffer for packet processing.
; Possible settings:
; Large - 32768 bytes
; Medium - 24576 bytes
; Small - 16384 bytes
; The number from 2048 to 64000 is indication in bytes (maybe defined
; in Kbytes, for this put letter 'K' after the number: 32K)
; By default the buffer size 16384 bytes is used.  
; Because the algorithm of processing in versions 1.04.xx it's recommended
; to set this field a little bit higher than usual size of incoming to your 
; system letters.  If the majority of most letter isn't more than 4k, then  
; set Buffers to 4096.  This will help to achieve the best productivity.   

Buffers 4096
;Buffers Large

; Keyword AreaBuffer defines the size of the memory block, which will be
; reserved for storage of information about echo-areas.  The number after
; this keyword interprets as degree of 2.  The meaning of this keyword is
; as follows: when the size of block is big, the access to echo-area is
; made somehow faster, but can lead to usage of some extra memory when 
; the program is working (when 8 is set, it takes about 15kb for each full 
; or not full 256 echo-areas, when it's 4, about 1kb for each full or         
; not full 16 echo-areas)  The possible settings are from 1 to 8.  
; Default definition is 8.

AreaBuffer 4

; Keyword QuietArc enables the redirection of messages from compression   
; programs, ran for packing mail bundles or unpacking received ones.   

;QuietArc

; Keyword BatchUnarc changes the order of incoming bundle processing.
; If it's uncommented, then all the found archives will be unpacked, and
; then the packet processing starts.  Otherwise, each bundle will be unpacked,
; then the attempt to prepare and pack the outgoing packets is being made, and
; after that the next bundle is processed.  This slows down the processing, 
; but saves you some disk space. 

;BatchUnArc

; Keyword SortArcMailBundles enables the sorting of the incoming packets 
; according to creation time before unpacking or tossing.  This can be useful
; when a lot of bundles are processed at once, maybe even for several days,
; when BatchUnArc is commented.

SortArcMailBundles

; Keyword PackFrequency regulates the ParToss behavior when BatchUnarc is
; disabled and you use MaxPktSize.  The meaning of this keyword is that
; when these conditions are met (and enabled AutoSend or using Send command)
; all the formed outgoing packets are analyzed.  Those of packets  size of
; which is more than maximum you set up, will be archived and prepared to be
; sent.  Keyword PackFrequency defines frequency of this analyze: 
; after each received bundle or after each processed packet.  By default 
; it's being done after the whole archive was processed.  If you have any
; problems with free space for tossing, then try to use it after each packet,
; but this will slow down processing.

;PackFrequency Packet
PackFrequency Archive

; Keyword SaveControlInfo defines weather to delete fields SEEN-BY and @PATH
; from the base or not.  This lets you to somehow shorten the size of your base
; and save some disk space.  You can enable this by setting SaveControlInfo to 
; No (by default - Yes, differently from Squish).  The deletion of these areas
; is made only in one-way parsing mode, or when using the fast algorithm
; (echo-area with point AKA or echo-area with only one link), and also in
; Purging mode, if the letter has already been sent.

SaveControlInfo No

; Keyword SaveLeftKludges enables you to either save or delete all the 
; unnecessary kludges, which aren't necessary for normal functionality of 
; the FTN-software or not necessary in FTN-technology.  This lets you 
; to somehow save some disk space.  You can enable this mode by setting    
; SaveLeftKludges to No (by default - Yes).  The deletion of these fields is
; made  only in one-way parsing mode, or when using fast algorithm (echo-area
; with point AKA or echo-area with only one link), and also in Purging
; mode, if the letter has already been sent.  In other words, the deletion
; of all the unnecessary kludges in this mode isn't guaranteed, because 
; the searching is being done until the first line, which isn't the kludge
; of FTN-technology. Some letters, which came through gates, that use other 
; technologies, contain the mix of "correct" and "incorrect" kludges.  In this
; case all kludges after the first "incorrect" kludge will be saved.

SaveLeftKludges No

; Keyword SaveTempEchoLog indicates that it's necessary to save temporary
; echotoss.log alike file named echolog.$$$, which is created in process
; of ParToss Purge Link command execution for instance.  This file might be
; used when processing areas with newly arrived mail by other external 
; utilities. 

;SaveTempEchoLog

; Keyword AddToArc enables echoprocessor to add new packets into mail bundles
; already created by ParToss in past executions, and also pack more than one
; packet into a single bundle (when MaxPktSize is defined).  By default this
; feature isn't used and the new archive is created at each execution.

AddToArc

; Keyword RenameBad enables echoprocessor to rename the incoming bundles to
; files with name like ????????.B??, if during uncompressing the Errorlevel
; 0 was returned.  By default currently it's not done.

RenameBad

; Keyword MaxPktSize defines the maximum size of created mail packets 
; (this value isn't precise, since the size is checked after each next letter
; was added to packet, which is why the size of a packet might be slightly
; bigger than you indicated).  After the size is reached, all the next
; messages for the address will be packed into a separate packet.  The size
; of a packet can be defined either in bytes, or in kilobytes.  In the last
; case right after the number (without the space) you need to put letter 'K'

MaxPktSize 100K
;MaxPktSize 50000

; Keyword MaxArchiveSize defines the maximum size of created mail bundles
; if AddToArc is enabled (this value isn't precise, since the size is
; checked after adding to bundle each next packet, which is why the size
; of a bundle might be slightly bigger than you indicated).  After the size
; is reached, all the next packets for the address will be packet into 
; the separate bundle.  The size of a bundle can be defined either in bytes,
; or in kilobytes.  In the last case right after the number (without the space) 
; you need to put letter 'K'
; When using keywords AddToArc, MaxPktSize, and MaxArchiveSize you can, for
; example, create bundles the size of which is 500K, containing a few 50-100K  
; packets.  

MaxArchiveSize 200K
;MaxArchiveSize 1000000

; Keyword Swap enables swapping when executing the external compression 
; utilities, and sets up the directory for swapping to disk (DOS version
; only).

Swap d:\

; Keyword Swaptype enables types of external memory, to which the swapping
; can be made when executing compression programs.  You can indicate:
; D - swap to disk (also is defined by keyword Swap);
; E - swap to EMS
; X - swap to XMS
; You can indicate any kind of combination, sorted in any order.         
; Warning!  Even if the swapping to disk is disabled, ParToss is unable to
; use any other kinds of memory, the program will try to swap to disk.  
; If keyword Swap is not found, the swap-file will be created in current
; directory. 
; If keywords Swap and Swaptype commented, the swapping will be disabled.

Swaptype DEX

; Keyword ScreenOutput defines the screen output in process of running:
; either using ROM BIOS or directly to video memory.  By default the output
; is made using functions ROM BIOS, which is slower, but guarantees the normal
; screen output, even if videoadapter isn't compatible with IBM. If you are
; sure about full compatibility of your videoadapter with IBM, use the 
; direct video memory option.       

;ScreenOutput BIOS
ScreenOutput Memory

; Keyword VisualSleep enables the visual pending of resource used by other
; task (for example a file of echo-area) when working in multi-tasking
; system.  Every 5 seconds (approximately) the line will appear on the 
; screen.  This will in some cases indicate pending instead of program crash.

VisualSleep

; Keyword ExportStyle specifies how to export messages into outgoing packets:
; In Fast mode as many file handles, as many enabled by your OS will be 
; opened at the same time (it's defined by command FILES in your Config.Sys);
; In Safe mode only one packet is opened at any time.           

ExportStyle Fast
;ExportStyle Safe

; Keyword ScanPassThrough enables scanning of echo-areas, described as 
; Passthru.  By default this mode is disabled.  If you use commands In
; and Out separately, you should enable it.

ScanPassThrough

; Keyword LockedAreaBehavior manages the behavior of ParToss in multi- 
; tasking systems, in case if echo-area, to which there is received letter or 
; echo-area with outgoing messages, is used by other process, message editor
; for instance.
; Format:
; LockedAreaBehavior <parameter>
; Possible parameters of this keyword:
; Wait - stop and wait until the echo-area is free (default)
; NoLock - open an echo-area in DENYNONE mode.  You need to use this mode 
;          with great care, because if both programs write something into
;          that file, its structure could be damaged.
; ToBad - when using In command, the letters for busy echo-area are moved   
;         to BadArea.  You can then export them back to its echo-area using
;         ParToss Bad.  When using Out, the letter is simply skipped until
;         the next execution.
; BackUp - the letters will be saved in temporary file.  All letters, which  
;          weren't exported into base, because that area was taken by other 
;          process, will be put in PtBackUp.Tkp file in working directory.
;          At next execution ParToss In this file will be checked for its
;          existence, and if present it will be renamed to PtBackUp.Pkt,
;          then processed as usual packet.  When using Out processing is done
;          in same manner as ToBad.

LockedAreaBehavior Wait

; Keyword SafeWrites enables dumping of buffers to disk, at each operation
; of writing into file.  In this case ParToss works much slower, but if
; the power is off when tossing, or system crash, it's less likely your
' base will be damaged.

;SafeWrites

; Keyword GroupsIgnoreCase indicates that groups A and a are considered
; the same group.  If you comment this keyword, then groups A and a will be
; considered as different groups, and will be processed respectively.  In any
; case there can be maximum of 52 groups.

GroupsIgnoreCase

; Keyword LinkType sets up reply-linking type. By default the reply-link
; is made by kludges @MSGID and @REPLY.
; Possible parameters:
; Subj - link by Subj field or its part (I use this);
; TimEd - link by @MSGID/@REPLY using mode "a lot of replies to a letter"
;         This mode is supported by TimEd. SQLink links areas this way;
; Flat - link by @MSGID/@REPLY combining messages in line link, e.g. 
;        if there are replies B and C, to letter A, then the link will look
;        like A-B-C. This mode is more useful than previous, if you use
;        GoldEd;
; Reply - this mode is almost the same as previous, but also the attempt to  
;         combine into one link letters that have the same @REPLY field.
;         This is useful when discussion on some topic lasts number of days,
;         source letter might already be deleted, but replies to it continue
;         coming.  This mode is used by default. 
; None  - disables linking.  This mode you can enable if you need to link 
;         just some echoes (you can setup other type of linking for them
;         when describing it).
;

;LinkType Subj
;LinkType Timed
;LinkType Flat
LinkType Reply
;LinkType None

; Keyword LinkLength defines the length of the Subj: field which will be used
; to compare letters and combine them into reply-link.  Of course, this should
; be used only when LinkType is set to Subj. By default the whole field is   
; used, except lines like "Re:" and spaces.  If you indicate somehow small 
; definition of this length, you can combine letters with following Subj:
; fields into one chain.
; Subj: Parma Tosser 0.80 beta 0506
; Subj: Parma Tosser 0.80 beta 0513
; Subj: Parma Tosser 0.80 beta 0514
; Subj: Re: Parma Tosser 0.80 beta 0506
; If you decrease this value to 1 symbol, you will have chains to different
; subjects ;)

LinkLength 15

; Keyword LinkNetMail enables netmail linking.  Right now only by field 
; Subj.  Besides this, after this keyword you can indicate parameter, which
; defines the size of buffer for netmail linking.  By default this buffer  
; is equal 1024 (not in bytes, but in letters).  Decreasing of this buffer
; might help you to save some RAM, but it's not recommended to set the size
; of this buffer less than possible number of letters in netmail area.    

LinkNetMail 256

;====================== Links description  ==============================

; Keyword Link defines some echoprocessor parameters for a certain address.
; Format of the following line is:
; Link <address> [~<Name>] [<+Flag>...] [<PktSize>[,<ArcSize>]] [&<packer>] [<#Password>] [<?PKTPASS>] [<@PASSTYPE>] [<$groups>] [<$-R/Ogroups>] [![<shablon>]] [<%days>]
;
; Here:
;
; <address> - full address of system for which the parameters are setup.  
;
; <Name> - name of station's system operator.  If this field is skipped, then 
; letter generated for this address when executing Hand and Kill will have   
; "SysOp" as name in To: field.  As in all other cases,  you need to put it       
; in quotation marks if the name is more than 2 letters. Symbol ~ before the
; name isn't its part.
;
; <PktSize> - number, possible with K modifier at the end, which overrides
; MaxPktSize for this address.  Modifier K indicates that the number is given
; in Kbytes.  After PktSize separated by come you can indicate parameter.
; <ArcSize> which overrides MaxArchiveSize for this address.  This makes sense
; only if AddToArc is enabled.
;
; <packer> - compression program which will be used to make mail bundles for
; this address (instead of DefaultPacker). Symbol & before the packer name 
; isn't its part.  The name length can be up to 9 symbols.
;
; <Password> - password for echo-manager.  Symbol # before the password
; isn't its part.  The length of the password is limited by Subj: (72
; symbols).  The letter case doesn't matter.  The password shouldn't contain
; space symbols (space, tabulation, CR/LF).
;
; <PKTPASS> - packet password.  Symbol ? before the password isn't its part.
; The length of the password is limited by length of field password in mail 
; packets (8  "ª›(r)®(r)›).  The letter case is significant.   
; If this password is indicated, then ParToss behavior changes:
; - when forming outgoing packets for this link, this password is written
;   in field password (when PASSTYPE 1 or 3);
; - before tossing the incoming packets, if for this link the password is 
;   indicated, they will be checked for password existence in received
;   packets.  If passwords don't match, the packet is considered as bad, and
;   isn't processed.  The corresponding warning is indicated (when PASSTYPE 2
;   or 3).
;
; <PASSTYPE> - number 1, 2 or 3, defining the ParToss behavior depending on
; packet passwords.
; 1 - set passwords to all the packets for this link;
; 2 - check the password in packets from this link;
; 3 - combination 1 and 2.
; By default definition PASSTYPE 1 is used: passwords will be written to 
; outgoing packets, but aren't checked for in received ones.
;
; <groups> - list of echo-area groups, to which this link can automatically   
; link/unlink.  Echo-area group is one Latin letter.  At each request to  
; echo-manager to change the area status, the presence of this group is 
; checked in link description.  The request will be processed only if the 
; group is indicated.  You can indicate up to 52 groups for each link.  
; Repeating symbols in this field aren't checked.
;
; <R/Ogroups> - list of echo-area groups, to which this link can only link
; as Read-Only.   At each request to echo-manager to link the echo-area
; the presence of this group is checked in link description.  If the group
; was found then the subscription for this group will be in Read-Only mode
; (key -x<address> in echo-area description).  You can indicate up to 52
; groups for each link.  This setting doesn't override the settings of 
; field <groups>, meaning that <R/Ogroups> should by sub-field of <groups>.
; Not that this field is only checked when linking the areas, so if in future
; you manually enabled your link to write to some areas, these rights will 
; remain until the link unsubscribe.
;
; <days> - number of days for storing the generated bundles for this address.
; If when executing Kill command, the bundles weren't sent for <days> days, 
; then they will be deleted.
; * Command Kill is only available in registered version   
;
; ! - indicates that this link will be subscribed to all newly created areas.
; After this field you can indicate (without space) a mask of echo-areas
; for which the autocreation is enabled.  By default all areas.
;
; <Flag> - one or more parameters: +A,-A,+B,-B,+H,-H,+S,-S,+X,-X
;          Flags can be grouped, for instance lines +A +S +H and +ASH
;          are considered the same.  But of course you can't group +A and -H.
; +A/-A - enable/disable echo-area autocreation for this address.     
; +C/-C - enable/disable packet append feature for this address.
; +B/-B - enable FileBoxes mode for this address (independently from sign).
; +T/-T - enable ArcMailAttach mode for this address (independently from sign).
; +I/-I - enable BinkStyle mode for this address (independently from sign).
; +H/-H - enable/disable "put mail on hold" mode for this address.
; +L    - enable "Local point" mode for this address.  If this flag will be   
;         defined, then letters, received from this address, will be changed
;         before exporting: instead of point address of boss, the corresponding
;         node address will be substituted.
; +N    - disable notification for this address when executing Kill command.
; +R/-R - enable/disable "Hide restricted areas" mode for this address.
;         This flag overrides keyword ManagerHideRestricted.
; +U    - disable request forwarding for this address.
; +S/-S -
; +X/-X -
; enable/disable the compatibility of archive names mode.  If one of your
; points (or your nodes) uses echoprocessor, that doesn't understand 
; Squish-style bundle names (not hex-symbol in first position of the name)
; enable one of these flags:
;
;  by default, and also -S and/or -X           +S            +X
;
; packets from point to boss  Nffffppp.???   nnnnffff.???   Bffffppp.???
; packets from boss to point  Pffffppp.???   nnnnffff.???   Affffppp.???
;
; here nnnn - difference between numbers of sender's and receiver's nets,
; ffff - in +S mode, difference between sender's and receiver's node numbers,
; ppp - point number.  All the definitions are in HEX.
; +Z    - enable "unique archive name" mode.  In this mode the names of mail
; bundles are formed using CRC32 from line
;     fromzone:fromnet/fromnode.frompoint~tozone:tonet/tonode.topoint
; In this case the situation when packets to addresses in different zones are
; included in one archive (which is possible with other variations of bundle 
; naming) is almost impossible.  For instance if we have two addresses,
; 2:5030/177.0 and 666:5030/177.0, and echomail exchange is being made with
; 2:5030/184.0 and 666:5030/184.0, then mail for both of these zones will be
; packet into the same packet, if Z mode is disabled.
;
; If the link description line seems too big for you, and inconvenient to 
; browse through and editing, you can divide it to several lines, as 
; indicated in following example for 2:5030/177.1.

Link 2:5030/51 ~"Peter Suchkow" &RAR +AISCZ -HR #dummy $ABCDZ
Link 2:5030/151 ~"Peter Suchkow" &RAR +AISCZ -HR #dummy
Link 2:5030/251 ~"Peter Suchkow" &RAR +AISCZ -HR #dummy $ABCDZ !
Link 2:5030/31 ~"Andrew Kosyakov" &RAR -HR +ISZ #dummy $ABCDZ
Link 2:5030/177.1 ~"Yag-Mort" 102400,153600 #superpassword $ABCDZ

Link 666:5030/184 +CZ 50K,250K %10 !

; Keyword LinkManager is identical to keyword Link.  The only difference
; is that link, described by this keyword, has the ability to remotely    
; manage the subscription of other links, switching the processed address
; using command %Address in message body.

; * Keyword LinkAdvanced works only in registered version.  This keyword 
; * defines some extended parameters for certain links.  This directive
; * is in development stage, which is why syntax will be changed.  Right 
; * now it's as follows:
;
;LinkAdvanced [#AREATAG] [$x:\path\path\path\box\]
;   Parameters:
;#AREATAG (the name of any existing echo-area is AREATAG).  When autocreating
;   areas from this link the echo-area AREATAG will be used as setting for
;   area's description, instead of settings defined in DefaultArea.
;$x:\path\path\path\box\ (of course you can indicate any path you want), this
;   directory will be used for this link as file-box instead of a standard 
;   file-box.  For instance, you can define file-boxes of your links using    
;   long file names or move file-box for local point to the net.  You will
;   need to take care of this catalog existence, since ParToss can't create
;   such a directories itself.

;====================== Echo Manager parameters ==========================

; Keyword ManagerName defines one or more names, which will be considered
; as name of echo-manager.  When one of these name is found in field To:
; the echo-manager will consider that this letter is addressed to it, and 
; will process this letter.  You can indicate unlimited number of names.

ManagerName ParToss
ManagerName "Parma Tosser"
ManagerName EchoMan
ManagerName AreaFix
ManagerName SqaFix

; Keyword ManagerIgnoreFrom defines one or more names that are considered
; the robot names.  The letters containing one of these names in field From:
; won't be processed, even if all other attributes, such as the sender's
; address, the name in field To: and the password define that this letter is  
; addressed to echo-manager.  You can indicate unlimited number of names.

ManagerIgnoreFrom ParToss
ManagerIgnoreFrom "Parma Tosser"
ManagerIgnoreFrom EchoMan
ManagerIgnoreFrom AreaFix
ManagerIgnoreFrom SqaFix
ManagerIgnoreFrom I-Track
ManagerIgnoreFrom NetManager

; Keyword ManagerHelp defines the file that contains some instructions
; on how to work with echo-manager.  When command %Help is received, the 
; echo-manager will generate a reply letter.  The text from this file will be
; included in the letter.  If this file is absent, or keyword is commented
; then command %HELP is ignored.  

ManagerHelp ParToss.Hlp

; Keyword ManagerDesc defines the default echo-area description, if the 
; description is absent in echo-area description file.  This is default       
; setting:

ManagerDesc "Description not available"

; Keyword ManagerHide defines group list, which won't be shown in a reply
; from echo-manager (using commands %List, %Notify, %Query).  For instance,
; your local areas, areas with personal mail, etc.

ManagerHide LH

; Keyword ListAsAvail enables the mode in which the %List requests to echo-
; manager are processed the same as %Avail.

;ListAsAvail

; Keyword GroupName defines the group names for output in echo-manager replies
; to command %List.  If you want the names indicated in receipt, the group list
; should be sorted using method Group.

GroupName A "General areas"
GroupName B "Book areas"
GroupName L "Local areas"
GroupName S "Programming"
GroupName Z "Autocreated areas"

; Keyword ManagerSubj defines the field Subj in letters generated by echo-
; manager.  Below is the default setting.

ManagerSubj "Reply from Parma Tosser Echo Manager"

; Keyword ManagerFromName defines the field From in letters generated by echo-
; manager.  Default setting is "Parma Tosser".

ManagerFromName "Best echo manager on market today"

; Keyword ManagerForwardName defines the field From in letters generated by 
; echo-manager when forwarding requests to uplink.  Default setting is
; "Parma Tosser".

ManagerForwardName "Best echo manager on market today"

; Keyword ManagerKill enables the deletion of processed letters to echo-
; manager.  In this case when processing the letters, echo-manager won't
; pay attention to attribute Rcv.  If this keyword is commented, after  
; the letter is processed, the attribute Rcv will be set to it, and in future 
; executions these letters won't be processed.

ManagerKill

; Keyword ManagerSize defines the maximum size of generated by echo-manager
; letter.  If when executing some kind of command the size of the letter    
; exceeds this setting, the letter will be cut to parts, size of which  
; will have the size equal to this parameter.  The numbering of these letters
; will be indicated in the body.  You can also indicate modifier K, which      
; works the same as for Buffers and MaxPktSize.  Minimum setting is 2 Kbytes.   
; By default this setting is disabled, and text of any length will be sent   
; in single letter.

ManagerSize 2K

; Keyword ManagerTemplate defines the file name of template for letters
; generated by echo-manager.

ManagerTemplate Manager.Tpl

; Keyword ManagerBadTemplate defines the file name of template for letters
; generated by echo-manager in case if echo-manager refused to process 
; the letter (unknown link or incorrect password).  The reason will be     
; indicated in field Subj of these letters: "Unknown link" or "Wrong password".

ManagerBadTemplate ManBad.Tpl

; Keyword ManagerReScan enables you to use command %ReScan <AREATAG>. By 
; default this feature is disabled.

;ManagerReScan

; Keyword ManagerGuardCharacter defines the symbol, which is considered
; as symbol '%' when executing command ParToss Hand.  Use of this symbol
; is needed if your command processor (4DOS for instance) corrupts words
; like %List in command line, and also when including this command into
; packet file.  You can use set by you symbol instead of '%'.  ParToss
; will recognize this command correctly, and problems with command processor
; will disappear.  The default setting for this symbol is '#'. 
; Commands:
;
; ParToss Hand 2:5030/177.1 %List
; ParToss Hand 2:5030/177.1 #List
;
; will lead to the same results. In 2nd case the danger of incorrect   
; processing is much lower.

;ManagerGuardCharacter # ; default setting
;ManagerGuardCharacter >

; Keyword ManagerUpLink enables to forward requests to uplink, if echo-area
; wasn't found at your system, and sets up necessary parameters for 
; generating the letter to uplink's echo-manager. Format:
;
; ManagerUpLink <address> <manager> <password> <echolist>
;
; Here <address> - uplink address, <manager> - name of uplink's echo-manager,
; <password> - password for echo-manager, <echolist> - file containing 
; the list of echo-areas, available at uplink.  This text file should contain
; echo-area descriptions, one area in each line. Format:
; ECHOTAG1
; ECHOTAG2 Description of area ECHOTAG2
; Everything after the description (following first space after ECHOTAG), 
; is ignored in current version.
; If this keyword is defined, then after receiving the request for 
; non-existent echo-area, the following actions will be made:
; - the requested area will be searched in file with echo-area descriptions.
;   If an area won't be found in any of files with uplink areas, then the
;   message that the area doesn't exist will be formed.
; - if echo-area is found, then:
; - the requested echo-area will be created       
; - requesting station and corresponding uplink will be linked to this area
; - the letter will be created to address <address> and name <manager> with 
;   <password> in Subj field, and echo-area name in body, which will link 
;   you to this area at your uplink's station.
; If this keyword is commented, the reply letter will be sent, saying that  
; this area doesn't exist on our station. 
; Besides this, when processing requests to unlink areas, it's checked  
; weather the area is "alive", and if found that the area is described as
; passthru, and contains only one downlink, then this area is deleted from
; configuration files.  If the last existing downlink is in ManagerUpLink
; list, then the letter requesting to unlink this area is generated.  Note:
; if the uplink isn't described by this keyword in some area, the area will
; be deleted, and ParToss won't generate the letter to unlink the area.  As
; a result this area will be created and deleted several times.

ManagerUpLink 2:5030/151 ParToss password1 echolist.151
ManagerUpLink 2:5030/151 ParToss password1 echolist.251
ManagerUpLink 2:5030/151 ParToss password1 echolist.51
ManagerUpLink 2:5030/48 AreaFix password2 echolist.31
ManagerUpLink 2:5030/31 AreaFix password3 echolist.31

; Keyword ManagerKillOrphan enables the deletion of areas defined as passthru,
; during the modification of echo-area list, if this area only has one 
; downlink.  The letter to uplink requesting to unlink this area will be
; generated as well if uplink is defined in ManagerUpLink.

ManagerKillOrphan

; Keyword ManagerHideRestricted disables the output of areas unavailable for 
; the subscriber in generated letters (for command %List).  If this keyword
; is commented, all the unavailable areas will be put in the receipt marked  
; as "Restricted".

;ManagerHideRestricted

; Keyword ManagerSortEnable enables the echo-area sorting when executing
; %List, %Notify, %Query, if it's indicated in command by parameters
; Group or Name.   After the keyword you can indicate the default setting for
; sorting.

;ManagerSortEnable Group
ManagerSortEnable

; Keyword ManagerString enables the multi-line echo-area descriptions when
; generating receipts for commands %List, %Notify, %Query, and also indicates
; the maximum length of the line.  If this keyword is enabled, then echo-area
; descriptions will be cut to a few lines if necessary.  Accepted settings  
; vary from 60 to 78.  Recommended setting is 74 (with this setting the length
; of quoted line won't be more than 80 which won't break the formatting)

ManagerString 74

;=======================Echo parameters ==============================

; Keyword AddToSeen defines address/address' which will be added to SEEN-BY
; for all echo-areas (considering zone).  In the example address' 5030/277 
; and 5030/377 will be added to SEEN-BYs in all echo-areas which have the 
; AKA in Zone 2.

AddToSeen 2:5030/277 377

; Keyword ZoneGate is used to delete SEEN-BY from all echo-mail, sent to
; certain nodes. 
;
; ZoneGate <host> <nodes...>
;
; <host> - address, for which mail will be processed. 
;
; <nodes> - address' which will be added to SEEN-BY when sending to this
; address.
; Parma Tosser won't include your address to this list, so you need to take
; care of it yourself.      

ZoneGate 666:5030/184 5020/51 5030/177 5030/184

; * Keyword DomainGate is used for realization of internet gating
; * (FidoNet <-> OtherNet).  The difference between ZoneGate is if you
; * use this keyword the sender's address, @MSGID, and Origin will be 
; * changed.  This keyword works only in registered version.  The format
; * of this keyword is as follows:
;
; DomainGate [<From] [>To] [=AKA] [&Echoes] [$Origin] [%Where]
;
; From - address from which the received mail will be gated.    
;
; To - address to which the gated mail will be sent.
;
; AKA - address, which will be substituted in gated letters.
;
; Echoes - echo-area or group of areas, for which the gating will be done. 
;          You can define:
;          &%Group ABCX - all echo-areas in indicated groups
;          &%All        - all echo-areas 
;          &*           - all echo-areas 
;          &SU.HARDW.*  - all echo-areas, which contain SU.HARDW.
;          &SU.BOOKS    - echo-area SU.BOOKS
;
; Origin - the Origin that will be substituted instead of original one.   
;
; Where - changeable blocks of information.  Possible settings: 
;         H - change the address in the message header, M - change @MSGID,
;         O - change the Origin, S - correction of SEEN-BY and PATH.
;         You can use any combination from these four letters.
;
; Any of parameters of this keyword can be skipped.  Gating is one-sided,
; so, if you want to make a two-way gate, you need to define two keywords.
;
; Short explanation. If parameter From is indicated, then the address from
; which the letter is received and the address indicated by this parameter
; will be compared.  If parameter To is indicated, then the address to 
; which the letter will be sent to, with the address defined by this parameter.
; If they match, then it's checked weather an echo-area belongs to indicated
; group of areas.  If an echo-area belongs to certain group, the letter is 
; changed according to the settings you indicated by parameter Where.  If 
; AKA is specified, this AKA will substitute the address from which the letter
; was received.

;DomainGate <2:* >666:5030/184 =666:5030/177 &%Group ABCDL $"Fidonet -> DevilNet gate" %HOS

; Keyword  PreservePath enables you to save lines @PATH in letters that are
; sent to other zone, to address not found in DomainGate and ZoneGate. 
; The @SEEN-BY isn't saved however.  If this keyword is commented, then lines
; @PATH will be deleted if sending letters to other zone.

;PreservePath

;=============================Include files & related=======================

; Keyword MakeAreaList enables the creation of additional echo-area description
; list, which an be used to include in configuration of external programs, 
; for instance, message editors.  For correct work of this function
; this keyword should be included BEFORE the description of all echo-areas.
; Because the format of this file is defined by user, you can configure it   
; as our reader/editor wishes.  First parameter after the keyword defines  
; the path and the name of a generated file.  Next parameter defines the 
; line format of defined file.  This file will be formed using corresponding
; macros.
; The following macros are recognized:
; @K - NetArea for netmail, EchoArea for echo-area, and areas described as
;      LocalArea, BadArea, DupeArea.
; @T - area echotag.
; @P - full path to the area (netmail directory, or group name of echo-area
;      files).
; @Y - area type.  For areas in Sq?-format it's substituted with " -$ ".
; @A - full address of AKA set for this area.
; @D - area description.
; @O - same as @D when @D is defined, otherwise same as @T.
; This file is created (updated) at each ParToss execution.

; Keyword AreaListShowAll enables you to include passthru echo-areas into the    
; echo-area list generated by MakeAreaList.  For the correct work of this

; Keyword EchoOnlyAreaList enables to include only echo-areas into the 
; list generated MakeAreaList, skipping the output of netmail areas,
; and areas described as BadArea, DupeArea, LocalArea.  For correct

; Keyword Include enables you to move part of settings into a separate file.
; If this keyword found, then indicated file will be parsed, and then ParToss
; will get back to main configuration file.  You can't use this directive in
; configuration files you are including, but you can define a few keywords    
; Include in main configuration, and spread different groups of information  
; in number of configurations.  Note, that after changing any of included 
; files, the full recompile will be done, just like if you changed the main
; one.

; Keyword AreaFile indicates file, to which the echo-area descriptions will
; be recorded when they are auto-created.  This is necessary, if your echo-
; area descriptions are in separate configuration file, indicated in keyword
